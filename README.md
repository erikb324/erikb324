- 👋 Hi, I’m @erikb324
- 👀 I’m interested in Cost Transparency (and all the ugliness that comes with looking through stuff), baseball, golf, and difficult problems
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Deep Learning, Machine Learning, and Signal Processing... python, powershell, and always deep in TBM stuff... and being a supervisor
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything relating to improving my technical, professional, and interpersonal skills
- 📫 How to reach me ... Zoom is best, but if you must email, use erik.brown@exxonmobil.com
